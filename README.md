# Amazon-Laptop-Price-Predictor
Problem Statement :- Suppose a user wants to buy the laptop and user have some specification such as Ram,Storage,Operating system and company and user want to know the price of the laptop.so solve this problem we have implemented the machine learning algorithm to figure out the price of the given specification for the given laptop.

# 
First we have uploaded the dataset:-https://github.com/Shivamsingh92/Amazon-Laptop-Price-Predictor/blob/main/laptop_price.csv

#
# Project flow-
1)EDA and Extraction of important column with respect to price and feature to be under consideration.

2)Data Preprocessing and Data cleaning with the help of Regular Expression.

3)Label Encoding

4)Model building

5)Implementing the Ml model for prediction

6) Got the accuracy of 86 by Random Forest Regressor.
